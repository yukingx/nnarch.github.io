# Our Journey starting from the ML pipeline
~ $ Searching near-optimal backbone arhcitectures
~ $ Adjusting hyperparameters and retraining
~ $ Multiscaling the deep nerual networks

# But way more beyond that for real-world analytics
~ $ Put more efforts for performance fine-tuning
~ $ Accelerating inference at edge devices
~ $ Deploy fine-tuned models on the ground!
~ $ Domain adaptation using distributed learning
```
