<p align="justify"> I'm interested in solving complex problems with staggeringly high dimensional data. Recently, my work explores subjects in computer vision and deep learning, more specifically concerning AutoML, Meta Learning, Model Scaling, and Distributed Learning. </p>
  
```markdown
# Our Journey starting from the ML pipeline
~ $ Searching near-optimal backbone arhcitectures
~ $ Adjusting hyperparameters and retraining
~ $ Multiscaling the deep nerual networks

# But way more beyond that for real-world analytics
~ $ Put more efforts for performance fine-tuning
~ $ Accelerating inference at edge devices
~ $ Deploy fine-tuned models on the ground!
~ $ Domain adaptation using distributed learning
```
