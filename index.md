# Our Journey starting from the ML pipeline

~ $ Searching near-optimal backbone arhcitectures

~ $ Adjusting hyperparameters and retraining

~ $ Multiscaling the deep nerual networks

# But way more beyond those efforts

~ $ Put more efforts for performance fine-tuning

~ $ Accelerating inference at edge devices

~ $ Deploy fine-tuned models on the ground!

~ $ Domain adaptation using distributed learning

```
